This repository contains the code for TECH DOCS, a technical documentation platform where users can upload blogs containing text and images, hosted entirely on AWS S3 - independent of any database!
This platform was created by Aryan Raj Dhawan and Shivam Jha, interns at Incedo Inc, in Summer 2024. 
Please note that the AWS access keys have not been included for security reasons.
